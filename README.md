# Lewis Tac-Toe Leaderboard
This application functions as a leaderboard for players of my Lewis-Tac-Toe website. 
The leaderboard currently works as a standalone, but at the moment does not add wins when playing the tic-tac-toe game.

I was able to test my APIs by testing the "I Just Won" button without logging in, and testing it after logging in. I also tried to call the API from another website, without having the website listed in my approved origins list, and the website was blocked from calling the API.
